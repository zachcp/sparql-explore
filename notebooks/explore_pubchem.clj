;; # Introduction
;; 

;; - CHEBI is looking really nice
;; - IDSM is fantastic and makes getting started iwth Pubchem quite reasonable
;; - https://idsm.elixir-czech.cz/chemweb/
;; - IDSM similarity tooling is good.
;; - Pubchem commitment to small RDF surface area means better name handling could 
;;   be created. [RDF](https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rdf)
;; - Easy to get an unbounded time query


;; # Pubchem Examples

;; ## E1: Donepezil Target
;; What protein targets does donepezil (CHEBI_53289) 
;; inhibit with an IC50 less than 10 ÂµM?
;; 
;;  Inline writing explains what is going on. The main
;;  difficulty is knowing the various relationships between
;; everything. The english-version is not too bad....
